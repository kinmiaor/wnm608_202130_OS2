       <div class="foodertext">In 2015, Mia was Chinese immigrants living in Seattle, and she saw the need for beauty that was both effective and indulgent.

Mia opened a store that instantly engaged their community, touching peopleâ€™s hearts as well as their skin. The first product was a soap that they hand-wrapped themselves.</div>
